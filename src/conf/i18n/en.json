Any subject and individual who meets the selection criteria can participate in the node election and obtain reward. Bytom2.0 will elect 10 Block Producers based on the number of votes, and these 10 selected nodes will take turns to produce blocks. Bytom2.0 has no candidate nodes.",
  "btm2_node_subtitle_1": "Introduction to the key points of the Bytom2.0 consensus algorithm",
  "btm2_node_des_1_0": "When the Bytom2.0 blockchain is just started, the federated node is responsible for generating blocks, while other nodes can stake BTM to become Block Producers, and ordinary participants can vote on Block Producers.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_1": "Each voting and election round is called an \"Epoch\". An Epoch contains a set of blocks (for example, 100). In this Epoch, the Block Producers is fixed. The next Epoch starts to re-elect the Block Producers based on the number of votes.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_2": "When the next Epoch detects that there are legal Block Producers reaching a certain number, the federation node stops producing blocks and the Block Producers produce blocks.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_3": "Starting from the current Epoch, 1 block is generated every 6 seconds, and each Block Producer generates blocks in turn according to the number of votes.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_4": "Bytom2.0 does not verify each block, but uses Checkpoint as a unit for processing. Generally, block number of one Epoch  is used as a Checkpoint.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_5": " Bytom2.0 will confirm each Checkpoint twice, once the Checkpoint status is Justified after receiving 2/3 confirmation, and it can be overturned at this time, and after its subsidiary nodes are also confirmed as justified status, get the second confirmation and get the Finalized status, thus the final confirmation is obtained and cannot be overturned.",
  "btm2_node_des_1_6": "In order to prevent harmless attacks, Bytom2.0 will punish Block Producers that sign two blocks at the same height at the same time, and confiscate part of their staked BTM. Considering the complexity of the staked BTM, Bytom2.0 will introduce the mechanism gradually after the consensus gets stabilized.",

  "btm2_node_des_3_0": "Candidates participating in Block Producer recruitment must stake at least 1,000,000 BTM, the BTM is for breach of contract as PoS punishment. If the BTM reaches 0 because of evil deception, the candidate will lose the qualification (even if the number of votes is in the top ten);",
  "btm2_node_des_3_1": "You should have your own servers, Block Producer operation and maintenance technologies that can run Block Producers (please refer to the detailed rules below for specific software and hardware requirements);",

  "btm2_node_des_4_1": "Block reward = the number of blocks produced by the node * the reward for each block, the more the number of blocks, the more rewards, the node suspension caused by the failure or the network will affect the reward.",

  "btm2_node_des_5_1": "The profits are determined by voting and dividends, and depending on the block production of the Block Producers. Assuming the total lock-up amount is 100 million BTM, 1 million BTM from the Block Producers, and 800,000 BTM votes are obtained at the same time, and the dividend is 80%, then the Block Producers can gain the profit of 600,000 BTM every year, with 60% APR (BTM standard).",

  "btm2_node_des_5_3": "The Block Producers will receive node rewards in real-time after the block is produced;",

  "btm2_node_des_5_5": "Ranking will be updated once per round (about 100 blocks)",
  "btm2_node_des_5_6": "Q4.  How much is the dividend reward for voters?",
  "btm2_node_des_5_7": "The dividend rewards for voters are set by the Block Producers.",
  "btm2_node_des_5_8": "Q5. Can I withdraw my vote after the votes are enough?",
  "btm2_node_des_5_9": "No, PoS requires Block Producers to pay votes as deposits in case of doing evil.",
